# 🧠 First ML Project

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to my inaugural end-to-end machine learning project! This repository showcases my journey through the complete ML pipeline—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment. It's designed to demonstrate my understanding and application of core ML concepts.


**Student Exam Performance Predictor** is a web-based application powered by a machine learning model trained on real student performance data. It predicts a student's expected **math score** based on:

- Gender
- Parental education level
- Test preparation status
- Reading and writing scores

Whether you're a **teacher**, **student**, or **data enthusiast**, this tool offers insight into how **machine learning** can enhance educational decision-making.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.13 installed
* [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (A faster Python package manager)

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HamzaImtiaz03/First_ML_Project.git
   cd First_ML_Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate an environment using `uv`**:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv add -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application locally**:

   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`and `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata` to interact with the app.

## 🧪 Usage

* Navigate to the local server URL.
* Input your data into the provided form.
* Submit to receive predictions generated by the trained ML model.
